    <h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
    <p>
      NotaQu Shelter (“NotaQu”) is an internal operational expense recording tool used within Shelter Indonesia.
      It supports receipt submission via Telegram and organizes records using Google services.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Access Model</h3>
    <p>
      NotaQu is operated using designated administrative or division PIC accounts. Only those authorized work
      accounts connect NotaQu to Google services. Other team members do not log in directly and do not grant
      individual Google permissions.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Data We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Receipt files</strong> (images or PDF documents) submitted by users via Telegram</li>
      <li><strong>Receipt metadata</strong> (date, amount, merchant, category, submission timestamp)</li>
      <li><strong>Telegram metadata</strong> (user ID, username, message metadata) required to process submissions</li>
      <li><strong>AI/OCR outputs</strong> derived from receipt processing (extracted text and structured fields)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Google User Data We Access</h3>
    <p>
      NotaQu accesses Google user data only to provide its core functionality. Depending on the workflow,
      this may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Drive (drive.file)</strong>: receipt files and documents created by NotaQu, or files explicitly
        selected for NotaQu. NotaQu does not request broad access to all Drive files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Sheets (spreadsheets)</strong>: spreadsheets used to store structured expense records such as
        date, amount, merchant, category, and timestamps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Docs (documents)</strong>: print-ready documents generated by NotaQu that embed receipt images
        and associated metadata for paper-based filing and audit purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gmail (gmail.send)</strong>: sending outbound emails from a designated administrative account containing
        generated documents or expense information. <strong>NotaQu does not read inbox content</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. How We Use Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Process receipts submitted via Telegram and extract required transaction fields</li>
      <li>Create and maintain structured operational expense records in Google Sheets</li>
      <li>Generate print-ready Google Docs with embedded receipt images and metadata</li>
      <li>Send user-facing operational emails from an administrative account (Gmail send only)</li>
      <li>Support internal tracking, reconciliation, and audit documentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. What We Do Not Do</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell Google user data or share it for advertising purposes</li>
      <li>We do not use Google user data for profiling or behavioral advertising</li>
      <li>We do not access unrelated Google Drive files, Docs, or Sheets</li>
      <li>We do not read, access, or modify Gmail inbox content</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Data Storage and Retention</h3>
    <p>
      Receipt files, generated documents, and structured records are stored in Google Drive, Google Docs, and
      Google Sheets under the organization’s authorized accounts. Retention depends on internal operational
      requirements. Data can be deleted by the organization by deleting the corresponding files or records.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>
      We do not sell or share user data with third parties, except:

      <li>When required to operate Google integrations (Google Drive, Sheets, Docs, Gmail) as authorized</li>
      <li>When required by applicable laws or official legal requests</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. Security</h3>
    <p>
      We use authentication controls, access restrictions, and API security measures to protect data from
      unauthorized access. Access is limited to authorized administrative or division PIC accounts.
